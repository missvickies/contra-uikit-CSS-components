This is a **short** personal project to learn and practice Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) by recreating the stylish and minimalist components found in [Contra UI Kit](https://contrauikit.com/). Drawing inspiration from Contra's funky yet simplistic design , I've coded these components using Sass to enhance my understanding of CSS preprocessing and improve my front-end development skills. The components included cover various UI elements such as buttons, input boxes, cards, and login/signup forms.
